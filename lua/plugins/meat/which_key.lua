-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded:
--  config = function() ... end
return {
    { -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
        "folke/which-key.nvim",
        event = "VimEnter", -- Sets the loading event to 'VimEnter'

                function() require("which-key").show({ global = false }) end,
                desc = "Buffer Local Keymaps (which-key)",
